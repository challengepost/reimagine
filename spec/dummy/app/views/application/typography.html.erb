<h1>h1. This is header level 1.</h1>

<p>
  This is a paragraph. Paragraphs are preset with a font size, line height and spacing to match the overall vertical rhythm. To show what a paragraph looks like this needs a little more content and <a href="#">a link</a> so, did you know that there are storms occurring on Jupiter that are larger than the Earth? Pretty cool.

  This is a paragraph with some <code>&lt;small&gt;</code><small>small text</small><code>&lt;/small&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;small&gt;</code> tag keeps the line height because it's meant to be use within content that is now <code>&lt;small&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p class="small">
  However, if your entire paragraph is small, then maybe you should use the <code>.small</code> class on it instead. Small text with huge line-height looks quite strange. And <code>&lt;small&gt;</code> had a <code>line-height: inherit;</code> CSS rule so it will have the same line height as it's parent. One would think that if the parent <code>line-height</code> is relative (uses <code>em's</code> or <code>%'s</code>) then <code>inherit</code> means that <code>&lt;small&gt;</code> will have a relative <code>line-height</code>, too. But the <code>inherit</code> property uses the computed values.<br>

  For example, a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> with <code>font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;</code> will have a computed <code>line-height: 24px;</code>, and so will the text within <code>&lt;small&gt;</code>.
